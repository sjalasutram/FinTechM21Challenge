# FinTechM21Challenge
Module 20 Challenge Work

This challenge work consists of blueprint of KaseiCoin and its crowsale implementation
The steps for this Challenge are divided into the following sections:

* Create the KaseiCoin Token Contract
* Create the KaseiCoin Crowdsale Contract
* Create the KaseiCoin Deployer Contract
* Deploy the Crowdsale to a Local Blockchain
* Optional: Extend the Crowdsale Contract by Using OpenZeppelin

## Technologies
The challenge work uses Solidity programming language to deploy a
